# Particle-Filter
Particle Filter implementation in CPP. 

This repo contains particle filter implementation in CPP. The idea was drawn from Udacity AI for robotics course. 
1) There is a Robot class that defines a basic 2D robot. It has its associated operations.
2) Particle filter is implemented for this example robot, to find the likely hood of its current position.
